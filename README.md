On a Mac (running OS X or MacOS), Vagrant can be installed using
Homebrew using the following command:

$ brew cask install vagrant

The 'brew install' commands without 'cask' tipically installs somewhat
simple, command-line software distributed under some FOSS license. In
contrast, 'brew cask install' commands can be used to install more
complex software, that has or interacts with a GUI and that is
licensed under some form of proprietary license.

By accident, I came accross the executable binary file
/usr/bin/sigdist.d on my Mac and that lead me to 'man sigdist.d' which
in turn sent me to Safari Books Online for the book DTrace: Dynamic
Tracing in Oracle and so I'm beginning to lear that DTrace is a
powerful tool that can help me performance-tune software and systems.

Just put a bunch of material in a queue and I'll start reading once I
have some availability.
